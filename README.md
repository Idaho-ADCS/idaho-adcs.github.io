# Building Documentation
1. Install [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/download.html)
    * For Windows, I recommend using the GUI

2. After opening the GUI, open the Doxyfile located at `doxygen/Doxyfile`
    * This Doxyfile is configured to build the doxygen documentation as seen in `html/`
    * Note that the paths under the Expert configuration tab are configured for my system and are not relative paths so may need to be changed for your system

3. Run Doxygen to build
